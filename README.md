# Pynomials
**_Python library for fast and easy polynomial calculations._**
##### This class creates polynomial objects with x terms. Create a polynomial expression/object by passing in coefficients in to 'Poly' class,
##### f = Poly(3, 2, 1)     -->   f(x) = 3x^2 + 2x + 1   
##### f = Poly(1, 0, 0, 9)  -->   f(x) = x^3 + 9
